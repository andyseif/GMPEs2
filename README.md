# GMPEs2
Stand-alone application to aid in developing GMPEs for PSHA software.
All included GMPEs should be able to provide a median and sigLn for a given period. 
Use a period of 0.0 for PGA, -1.0 for PGV, -2.0 for PGD (if applicable).

**Note the updated "GMPE Utils" file. It now has a "HelperMethods" class. This is where we should store all methods that could be used for multiple GMPEs.
